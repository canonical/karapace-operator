# Charmed Karapace Documentation

The Charmed Karapace Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on [Karapace](https://www.karapace.io/).

Karapace provides an open source alternative to Confluent's [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html#sr-overview). It is a solution to enforce data validation, consistency, serialization/deserialization... It is used as an additional service by producers/consumers to support data operations.

As Karapace requires a running Kafka cluster, this operator makes use of the [Kafka Operator](https://github.com/canonical/kafka-operator) in order to work.
